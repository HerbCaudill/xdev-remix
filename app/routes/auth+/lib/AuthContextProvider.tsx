/**
 * This provider wraps the entire app. We can be in three possible scenarios when we load:
 *
 * (A) FIRST LOAD
 *     This is the very first load on first use. In this case, we need to start the auth flow by
 *     redirecting to another route.
 *
 * (B) COMPLETING AUTH FLOW
 *     We've just gone through the auth flow and we've been redirected back here. We'll know this is
 *     the case because the auth routes will use Remix's location state to pass back some setup info
 *     (e.g. a team name if we're creating a team, or an invitation code if we're joining a team),
 *     which will allow us to instantiate the user, device, team, auth provider, and repo.
 *
 * (C) ALREADY AUTHENTICATED
 *     We've used the app before. We'll know this is the case because we'll have a user & device in
 *     local storage. We can use these to instantiate the auth provider and the repo, each of which
 *     will have their own stuff in indexedDb.
